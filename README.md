# SOLID Sensors

**Description**:  IoT sensors library for effective project development. The library implementation observes the Object Oriented Programming paradigm's SOLID Principles for enhanced design-time qualities (including maintainability, reusability, and readability), without necessarily undermining run-time qualities (including time and space complexity). The library makes it easy to use sensors in IoT projects in a modular style, such that high quality code is achieved with minimum effort.

The library is implemented for specific sensors, with a template class file provided for sensors yet to be included.
