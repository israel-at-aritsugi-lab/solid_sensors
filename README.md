# SOLID Sensors

**Description**:  IoT sensors library for effective project development. The library implementation observes the Object Oriented Programming paradigm's SOLID Principles for enhanced design-time qualities (including Reusability, Extensibility, Simplicity and Maintainability (RESM)), without necessarily undermining run-time qualities (including time and space complexity). The library makes it easy to use sensors in IoT projects in a modular style, such that high quality code is achieved with minimum effort.

The library is implemented for specific sensors, with a template class file provided for sensors yet to be included.


Features
=============
The library can be used in two main ways:
- [Skeletal form](./examples/example1-simple.cpp); use in the simplest form
- [Complete form](./examples/example2-with-handler.cpp); use with SensorHandler class
